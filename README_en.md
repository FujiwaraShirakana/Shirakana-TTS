觉得现在存档还是为时过早，至少等语音合成的几个项目停更再说（）

Discussions我开了，如果有什么问题可以在里面提，等其他大佬的回答就可以了，issue请发布确定为BUG的反馈或对于期望加入的功能的反馈。

## Usage：
    1、Download the software package in the release and unzip it.

    2、Download the corresponding pre-models or additional modules in the [Vocoder & HiddenUnitBert] repository above and place them in the corresponding folders, the correspondence between pre-models and projects will be mentioned below.

    1. Place the model in the Mods folder, and select the model from the "模型选择" Module at the top, for the standard model structure, please refer to "Supported Projects" below.

    4, enter the text to be converted in the input box below, click "启用插件" to execute the text Cleaner (SoVits/DiffSvc need to enter the audio path, DiffSinger need to enter the path of the ds or json project file)

    5, click "开始合成", you can start synthesizing voice, wait for the progress to complete, you can preview in the player, you can also save directly
---
## Making models：
- The software standardizes the model reading module, the model is placed in a subfolder under the Mods folder. ********.json file is used to declare the model path and its display name, etc. The model needs to be converted to Onnx, the repository for exporting onnx will be mentioned below

### General parameters(All types of models must be filled in, if you do not fill in the model will not be recognized)：
- Folder: the name of the folder where the model is saved
- Name: the name of the model displayed in the UI
- Type: model category
- Rate: sampling rate

## Cleaners
```cxx
/*
Plugins should be placed in the Plugins folder and should be a dynamic library exported as required, the dll should be named Plugin Name, the Plugin Name is the content filled in the Cleaner column in the Model Definition Json file.
All Plugins dlls need to define the following functions, the function name must be PluginMain and the Dll name must be the Plugins name (or Cleaner name).
*/
const wchar_t* PluginMain(const wchar_t*);
// The interface only requires consistent input and output, not consistent function, that is, you can implement any function you want in this Dll, such as ChatGpt, machine translation, etc.
// For example, the PluginMain function passes in a string "input", passes "input" into ChatGpt, then passes the output of ChatGpt into Clean, and finally returns the output.
wchar_t* PluginMain(wchar_t* input){
    wchar_t* tmpOutput = ChatGpt(input);
    return Clean(tmpOutput);
}
// Note: Please use extern "C" keyword when exporting the dll.
```
